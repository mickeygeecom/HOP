## Bugs

[Low]
- Correct options should not be send directly to the client prior to submitting an answer, this opens the opportunity for cheats


## Features
- Scheduele quizzes, differentiate persistant quizzes and quizzes with a 'time of life' (period) with a more "live" and in it together experience
- Log/save how players are doing, but this would need some sort of player identifier
- Access Control, f.eg. "keys" or "tokens" in headers in the backend? when using accessing the management frontend
    -> Splitting up endpoints which require "auth", and which that does not.
